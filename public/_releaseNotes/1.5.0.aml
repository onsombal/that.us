versionNumber: v1.5.0
date: October 27th, 2020

notes: This sprint can be summed up with just a simple old fashioned butt whooping. This sprint we introduced XState but really added integration for finite state machines helping orchestrate the UI and potentially reuse it across multiple products. The spirt of this sprint was adding this notion of Communities and the ability to follow things you might find interest in.
